# AMDC Syria Progress

### - Unit Spawning ✅
〔 - Units spawn in defined zones randomly in amount defined in zones.lua
〔 - SAM types vary by what difficulty of zone are they spawned in. These are Easy (SA-3, SA-6), Medium (SA-2, SA-11), Hard (SA-10, SA-5).
〔 - Zones and airports have seperate spawning amounts.
### - Capturable Zones ✅
〔 - OPSZONES class is pretty simple zones have 3 states Guarded, Conflict and Empty. 
〔 - Guarded means the zone is Guarded by forces that captured the zone and is not under attack. 
〔 - Conflict means there are both Friendly and Enemy forces in the zone.
〔 - Empty means that the zone is capturable by either Blue or Red forces.
### - MANTIS Integration ✅
〔 - Smarter SAM AI. Now SAM's can detect HARM's and react properly.
〔 - SAM's will use the EWR network to theyre advantage. SAM's will not shoot until theyre active then they will activate and shoot at you.
### - Redair GCICAP ✅
〔 - Red forces are doing CAP and Intercepts based on the EWR network.
〔 - Enemy aircraft will either do a racetrack pattern around theyre airfiled or a defined zone
〔 - Enemy planes will also intercept incoming aircraft.
### - Supply system 🔨
〔 - Not yet decided on the solution here.
### - CTLD Integration 🔨
〔 - Deploying capture squads/airport defenses and transporting supply.
### - CHIEF Integration 🔨
〔 - Dynamic deploying of A2G, A2A, G2G units by both Red & Blue forces.
### - Moving frontline/borders 🔨
〔 - Pretty self-explanatory
